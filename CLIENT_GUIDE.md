## For Developers (One-Time Setup)

### Deploying Schema Changes
When schema changes are made locally, deploy them once:

```bash
cd wh-pubs
npx sanity login
npm run deploy
```

This updates the hosted Sanity Studio at https://whpubs.sanity.studio

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Netlify:
- `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: it7wwto3
- `SANITY_DATASET`: production

### Webhook Setup (Optional but Recommended)
To trigger automatic Netlify rebuilds when content changes:

1. In Sanity Studio, go to API ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/[YOUR_BUILD_HOOK_ID]`
3. Set it to trigger on: Create, Update, Delete

This ensures the website rebuilds automatically when content is published.
