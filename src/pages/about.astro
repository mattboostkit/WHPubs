					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>What began as a single pub in Shipbourne has grown into a collection of characterful pubs, each with its own unique personality but united by our commitment to exceptional hospitality. Over the decades, we've carefully restored and revitalized historic pubs, preserving their architectural heritage while updating them for modern comfort.</p>
					
					<p>From the historic timber beams of The Bull to the Georgian elegance of The Rose and Crown, each pub tells its own story while sharing our common values of quality, warmth, and genuine hospitality. We've spent years perfecting the balance between tradition and innovation, ensuring every visit feels both familiar and special.</p>

					<h2>Our Approach</h2>
					<p>We believe in maintaining the traditional warmth and welcome of a British pub while offering contemporary comfort and cuisine. Each of our pubs is deeply rooted in its local community, supporting local suppliers and hosting events that bring people together.</p>
					
					<p>Our Development Kitchen works closely with local farmers, brewers, and artisan producers to create menus that celebrate the best of British cuisine with a modern twist. From traditional Sunday roasts to innovative seasonal dishes, every meal is crafted with care and served with pride.</p>

					<h2>The WH Pubs Family</h2>
					<p>Behind every great pub is a great team. Our staff are the heart of WH Pubs, bringing personality, expertise, and genuine care to every interaction. Many have been with us for years, growing their careers and becoming integral parts of their pub's community.</p>
