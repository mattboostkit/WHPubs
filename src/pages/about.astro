										<p>Brian Keeley Whiting started life as a chef in The Savoy in London then went on to working in some fantastic place in London including a Roux Brothers restaurant, he eventually came out the kitchen to join Brunning and Price as a Manager after 10 great years he left as a Director to start on his own business with his pal Chris Hammond.</p>
										
										<p>In September 2003 Brian started with the Chaser Inn, Tonbridge and currently has 5 operations, his passion is taking on failed sites and turning them around making great venues for people to meet, eat, drink and enjoy themselves in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
										
										<p>WH Pubs is a family run independent company that produces home cooked traditional British food with a daily changing menu. We use local artisan suppliers some of which have worked with Brian along the way over 30 years, we have daily deliveries with seasonal ingredients. We do go that extra mile to source British products supporting our British Farmers where ever we can.</p>
										
										<p>We run Great British Pubs, our definition is; a good range of beers and local real ales, decent wine, great home cooked food, a classic beer garden and in the winter, roaring fires, pub games and a warm welcome!</p>
										
										<p>Brian has been acknowledged by his peers within the hospitality industry as a great independent operator, he sits on the council for UK Hospitality along with other leaders in its category. The pubs have won numerous awards over the years and continue to strive to be the best they can.</p>
										
										<p>Along with running pubs, Brian's passion is rugby and Liverpool F.C. - and not forgetting cooking!</p>
