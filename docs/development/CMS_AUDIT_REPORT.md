# WH Pubs Sanity CMS Comprehensive Audit & Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This audit examined the WH Pubs Sanity CMS setup to identify what content is CMS-editable versus hardcoded. The review found that while most major content areas are managed through CMS, several key components still contain hardcoded data. This report details the current status and provides implementations to make all content CMS-manageable.

## Current CMS Status

### ✅ **Fully CMS-Managed Content**

1. **Core Content Types**
   - Blog posts (`post`) - With pub-specific filtering
   - Pub information (`pub`) - Comprehensive 69-field schema
   - Menus (`menu`) - Associated with specific pubs
   - Events (`event`) - Pub-specific or hub-wide
   - Careers (`career`) - Job listings
   - Team members (`teamMember`) - Staff profiles

2. **Page Settings & Content**
   - Homepage (`homepage`) - Hero section, featured dishes
   - Development Kitchen (`developmentKitchen`) - Complete content management

## Data Population Scripts

Three scripts created for initial content population:

   - Creates sample suppliers (Kent Farm Fresh, Shepherd Neame, etc.)
   - Includes contact information and specialties
   - Ready for logo uploads

2. **`populate-amenities.js`**
   - Creates 19+ standard amenities with proper categorization
   - Sets "Sunday Roast" and "Dog Friendly" as standard (auto-included)
   - Includes special features like "Tiki Huts"

3. **`populate-homepage-stats.js`**

   - Configurable icons and colors
   - Animation-ready

## Booking Widget Integration

### ✅ **Already CMS-Managed**
- LiveRes site IDs stored in pub schema (`liveResSiteId` field)
- Site ID validation ensures proper UUID format
- Component updated to remove hardcoded mappings

### Current Site IDs in Database:
```

```

## Social Media Integration

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Run data population scripts** to create initial content
2. **Update PubAmenities component** to use new amenity system
3. **Update EnhancedSocialFeed** to use CMS data instead of mock content

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Update PubSuppliers component** to use supplier schema
2. **Integrate gift card component** with existing schema
3. **Create homepage stats component** using new CMS data

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
1. Add image upload capabilities to social media content
2. Create admin interface for bulk amenity assignment
3. Implement social media API integration for live content

## Content Editor Benefits

### Before Implementation
- Social media content was hardcoded mock data
- Amenities were inconsistent free-text tags
- Supplier information wasn't manageable

- **Amenities**: Standardized amenity selection with custom additions
- **Suppliers**: Full supplier relationship management with logos and details
- **Statistics**: Editable homepage numbers with custom icons and animations
- **Consistency**: Standardized content across all pubs with pub-specific overrides
