# Navigation Menu Improvements

## Current Changes Made ✅

1. **Moved "About" next to "Our Pubs"** - Creates a logical grouping of core company information
2. **Removed "Blog" from navigation** - Keeps content accessible but reduces menu clutter

## Additional Streamlining Suggestions

### 1. **Group Related Items** (Recommended)
Consider organizing the menu into logical groups:

**Core Business:**
- Our Pubs
- About

**Services:**
- Development Kitchen
- Events

**Customer Actions:**
- Gift Cards
- Contact
- Join Our Crew

### 2. **Shorten Menu Items** (Recommended)
- "Development Kitchen" → "Kitchen"
- "Join Our Crew" → "Careers"
- "Gift Cards" → "Gifts"

### 3. **Consider Dropdown Menus** (Advanced)
For even more streamlining, consider dropdown menus:

**Main Menu:**
- Our Pubs
- About
- Services (dropdown: Kitchen, Events, Gifts)
- Contact
- Careers

### 4. **Mobile-First Approach** (Recommended)
- Ensure the menu works well on mobile devices
- Consider a hamburger menu for mobile
- Keep the most important items visible on mobile

### 5. **Visual Hierarchy** (Recommended)
- Use different font weights or sizes to create hierarchy
- Consider grouping related items visually
- Add subtle separators between groups
