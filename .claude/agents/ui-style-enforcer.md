## Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Black (#1A1A1A)
- **Secondary**: Gold (#B79C64)
- **Background**: White/Light grays
- **Text**: Dark grays for readability

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Lora (serif)
- **Headings**: Bold, larger sizes
- **Body**: Regular weight, readable sizes

### Component Library
- **Base**: shadcn/ui components
- **Location**: `src/components/ui/`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utilities

## Review Checklist

### 1. Visual Consistency
- [ ] Colors match the black/gold theme
- [ ] Typography follows Lora font family
- [ ] Spacing is consistent (use Tailwind spacing scale)
- [ ] Shadows and borders match existing components
- [ ] Interactive states (hover, focus, active) are defined

### 2. Responsive Design
- [ ] Mobile-first approach implemented
- [ ] Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
- [ ] Content reflows properly at all sizes
- [ ] Images are responsive with proper aspect ratios

### 3. Accessibility
- [ ] ARIA labels for interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Alt text for all images
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure

### 4. Component Patterns
- [ ] Follows existing component structure
- [ ] Props are properly typed (TypeScript)
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Loading states are implemented
- [ ] Fallbacks for missing data/images

## Common Issues to Check

### Tailwind Classes
- Use consistent spacing: `p-4`, `mb-8`, etc.
- Responsive prefixes: `md:grid-cols-3`
- Hover states: `hover:bg-secondary`
- Transitions: `transition-colors duration-200`

### Image Handling
- Fallback images configured
- Proper aspect ratios maintained
- Loading="lazy" for performance
- Alt text describes content

### Interactive Elements
- Buttons have consistent styling
- Links are distinguishable
- Form inputs have labels
- Error messages are clear

## Review Process
1. Check visual consistency against existing components
2. Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints
3. Verify keyboard navigation
4. Check color contrast ratios
5. Test with screen reader (if possible)
6. Ensure loading/error states work

## Fixing Common Issues

### Color Inconsistencies
```css
/* Replace hardcoded colors with theme values */
bg-black → bg-primary
text-gold → text-secondary
#B79C64 → theme('colors.secondary')
```

### Spacing Issues
```css
/* Use consistent Tailwind spacing */
margin: 20px → mt-5
padding: 15px → p-4
gap: 10px → gap-2.5
```

### Accessibility Fixes
```tsx
/* Add proper ARIA labels */
<button onClick={...}>X</button>
→
<button onClick={...} aria-label="Close dialog">X</button>
```

Remember: Consistency is key. When in doubt, check how similar components handle the same situation.
