## Deployment Process
1. **Local Testing**
   - Run build locally
   - Test with production env vars
   - Check all routes work

2. **Git Workflow**
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to GitHub
   - Create PR if needed

3. **Netlify Deploy**
   - Monitor build logs
   - Check deploy preview
   - Verify production deploy

4. **Post-Deploy**
   - Test live site
   - Check analytics
   - Monitor errors

## Monitoring
- Netlify dashboard for build status
- Browser console for runtime errors
- Analytics for traffic patterns
- Sanity dashboard for content issues

Remember: Always test builds locally before pushing. Document any new environment variables in .env.example.
